# trie

Trie and Tests created by David Lim and Elyanil Castro

Tries uses:
-insert(self, string): will insert the input string into the trie. If character in the input string is already present, it will be ignored.
-contains(self, string): will return True if the string is in the trie, False if not.
-size(self): will return the total number of words contained within the trie. 0 if empty.
-remove(self, string): will remove the given string from the trie. If the word doesnâ€™t exist, will raise an appropriate exception.

Binary Search Tree Implement a binary search tree with insert(), search() size(), depth(), contains(), balance()

BST Traversals Implement the following traversals:

in_order(self) pre_order(self) post_order(self) breadth_first(self)

Each returns a generator that will yield nodes according to their conventions:
